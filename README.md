+ Presenter : Contains view logic for preparing content for display ( received from the Interactor ) and for reacting to events ( by requesting new data from the Interactor ).
+ Entity : Basic model objects used by the Interactor. 
+ Router : Control navigation between screens ( I don't use a router layer since this is a simple app and thus don't require any navigation )
